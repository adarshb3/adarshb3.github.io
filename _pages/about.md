## 🚀 About Me
I am a Research Associate specializing in Accounting at the Indian School of Business (ISB) and a Business Analytics graduate from the ISB Institute of Data Science.

## 🔬 Research Interests
Natural Language Processing, Financial Accounting, AI and Machine Learning, Financial Economics.

## 🤖 Accounting Meets Machine Learning
As someone deeply passionate about both accounting and machine learning, I am excited to be working at the intersection of these two fields. By leveraging the power of machine learning, I aim to bring innovation and efficiency to accounting processes. I have recently written a detailed Medium article where I demonstrate how to build a data workflow management system using Mage AI. Check it out [here](https://medium.com/towardsdev/streamline-your-data-workflow-configure-mage-ai-with-postgres-to-build-your-first-data-pipeline-6f8fbe7915a1) to see how you can streamline your data workflows and enhance your analytical capabilities.
