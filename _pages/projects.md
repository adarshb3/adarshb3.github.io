### Anomaly Detection in Business Processes using Generative AI
*ISB Capstone Project with Deloitte*

I led the development of an application aimed at generating actionable insights in expansive business datasets to elevate financial governance. This project encompassed all phases, from liaising with sponsors and faculty mentors, high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD), complete code implementation, large language model (LLM) and agent identification, and testing, to data orchestration and deployment. The result was an AI-powered solution that enhances anomaly detection in business processes using generative AI techniques.

### Virtual Try-On Prototype with Flask, Twilio, and Gradio’s API using IDM-VTON Model.
*Independent Project*

Built a virtual try-on application where users can send images via WhatsApp to virtually try on garments, leveraging Nymbo’s Virtual Try-On Gradio’s API which uses IDM-VTON. Integrated Flask to manage the backend API, Twilio for WhatsApp-based interaction, and Ngrok for local server exposure. The system processes the user’s images and returns a virtual try-on result in real-time through WhatsApp.

### Forecasting Electricity Consumption using Azure Auto ML
*Independent Project*

I developed a forecasting model using Azure Auto ML to predict electricity consumption in industrial and commercial sectors. The model achieved less than 2% deviation and was deployed as an application on Streamlit. This project demonstrated the practical application of machine learning in energy management and forecasting.

### Image Segmentation on Pathology Images using UNet with ResNet
*Independent Project*

In this project, I finetuned a UNet model with ResNet as the backbone for image segmentation on pathology images. The model was trained with mask images where nuclei were marked, achieving a best validation loss of 10%. This work contributed to advancements in medical image analysis and segmentation.

### Building a RAG System for Data Retrieval and Content Generation
*Independent Project*

I built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for evaluating in-house data retrieval and content generation capabilities using established Generative AI models like BERTScore and GPT-4. This project involved creating a Knowledge Repository from sentiment datasets, enhancing the system's ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant information.
